    <h1>Once upon a time...</h1>
      <p>... there was a <span>{{character}}</span> named <span>{{name}}</span>. They had grown up alone in
        a <span>{{location}}</span> as their parents had died when they were very young. Although they had
        often dreamed of <span>{{dream}}</span>, it was actually their destiny to <span>{{destiny}}</span>.</br>
        One day, while <span>{{activity}}</span>, <span>{{name}}</span> encountered a magical object: <span>{{artifact}}</span>. They were
        not to know how valuable this <span>{{object}}</span> would be: it was actually the magical artifact
        sought by their arch-nemesis: <span>{{nemesis}}</span>. </br>
        <span>{{name}}</span> was about to start the biggest quest of their lives: a quest through <span>{{landscape}}</span>
        with their faithful companion, <span>{{companion}}</span>, to <span>{{task}}</span> the magical artifact. </br></p>
